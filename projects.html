            <span class="post-date">October 25, 2016</span>
            <p>On September 24th, Morristown Beautiful hosted a clean up event at Burnham Park. The MHS Engineering Club was commissioned by a representative of Morristown Beautiful to create a Duck Race as a part of the barbecue that honored the volunteers of the clean up. Each volunteer was assigned a rubber duck with a number that was then put in the race which started in the lake. The winner was awarded a $50 gift certificate to anywhere in Morristown.</p>

            <p>Last April, the Community Service Division of the Engineering Club in association with the Morris County Prosecutor's Office, hosted a medicine drive in the parking lot of MHS. Anyone with expired medication was encouraged to drop it off at the drive. Below is an image of all the medication the collected on that day. In total, the Prosecutorâ€™s Office disposed 700lbs of expired medication(there were other drives the same day as ours).</p>
